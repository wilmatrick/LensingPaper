We've presented different dynamical models for the central region of J1331. Some of them capture the observed kinematics, but none of them work at both small and large radii. In the following we discuss possible reasons, also by comparing our results to previous work.

\subsection{On J1331's central stellar mass-to-light ratio} \label{sec:MLdiscussion}

Some of the ambiguities in recovering J1331's matter distribution could be resolved by learning more about stellar populations with different IMFs in J1331. In particular, a sophisticated guess for the stellar mass-to-light ratio in the bulge could be compared to our very reliable measurement of the total mass-to-light ratio inside the Einstein radius (see Table \ref{tab:einsteinML}). This would then either support or contradict the presence of a significant amount of DM in the bulge.

Traditional choices for the IMF are the bottom-heavy IMF by \citet{Salpeter1955},
$$\xi(m) \propto m^{-x}, x=2.35,$$
where $\xi(m) \diff m$ is the number of stars with mass $m$ in $[m,m+\diff m]$, and the IMFs by \citet{2002Sci...295...82K} and \citet{Chabrier2003}, which are in agreement with each other and predict less low-mass stars.

\citet{Ferreras} found a relation between the central stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_0$ in early-type galaxies and the IMF slope $x$; a higher $\sigma_0$ suggests a more bottom-heavy IMF. For a unimodal (Salpeter-like) IMF and $\sigma_0 \simeq 200~\text{km s}^{-1}$ in J1331 (see Figure \ref{fig:kinematics}) they predict $x \approx 2.33$, which is close to the standard Salpeter slope, also supported by \citet{2014MNRAS.438.1483S}. When assuming a bi-modal (Kroupa-equivalent-like) IMF, \citet{Ferreras} predict $x \approx 2.85$ for J1331's central velocity dispersion. This is more bottom-heavy than the standard \citet{2002Sci...295...82K} IMF. Overall, the central velocity dispersion suggests a rather bottom-heavy IMF in J1331's bulge and therefore large stellar mass-to-light ratio. \citet{SWELLSI} estimated J1331's stellar bulge mass given a Salpeter IMF and measured the I-band AB magnitude of the bulge. Transformed to a stellar I-band mass-to-light ratio their results would correspond to $\Upsilon_\text{I,*}^\text{sal} = 4.7 \pm 1.2$ (see Table \ref{tab:previousresults}).

We compare our findings of the stellar mass-to-light ratios with the study by \cite{SWELLSV}: They found that the bulge of J1331 has an IMF \emph{more} bottom-heavy than the Salpeter IMF from fitting a NFW halo to (1) the Einstein mass and (2) gas kinematics at larger radii $\gtrsim 8''$. In Section \ref{sec:results_JAM_NFW} we fitted a mass model with NFW halo to (1) the Einstein mass and (2) stellar kinematics within $\sim 3.5''$. Our best fit $\Upsilon_\text{I,*} = 4.2 \pm 0.2$ (see Table \ref{tab:modelB4_bestfit}) indicates a \emph{less} bottom-heavy IMF than the Salpeter IMF. \cite{SWELLSV} found systematically lower NFW halo masses ($v_\text{circ,halo}(5'') \sim 120~\text{km s}^{-1}$ according to their Figure 2) than we did ($v_\text{circ,halo}(5'') \sim 200~\text{km s}^{-1}$).

\end{figure}
%==============

In Figure \ref{fig:vcirc_comparison} we compare the circular velocity curve found by \citet{SWELLSV} with a mass-follows-light model scaled to fit our Einstein mass (by multiplying the light distribution in Table \Wilma{[TO DO]} with $\Upsilon_\text{I,tot}^\text{ein} = 5.6$). Within $R < 5''$ they agree with each other. 

The models in this work used more than just the Einstein mass to constrain the matter distribution at small radii: The lens mass model constrained also the shape of the mass distribution within the lensing image configuration at $R_\text{ein} \sim 1''$. The dynamical models used stellar kinematics inside $R' \simeq 3.5''$ \Wilma{[TO DO: Check]}. We compare the lens mass model's $v_\text{circ}$ (for $\alpha=1.0\pm 0.1$) with the NFW JAM model (Table \Wilma{[TO DO]}) in Figure \ref{fig:vcirc_comparison} as well. Within and around $R_\text{ein}$ they are consistent with each other, even though they where independently derived. They do not agree with the result by \citet{SWELLSV} and in Section \ref{sec:results_JAM_SB} we showed, that ``mass-follows-light'' is not a good model for J1331.

Overall, we were not able to find a consistent explanation for J1331's central $v_\text{rms}$ dip. It cannot be due to tangential velocity anisotropy in the center alone (see Section \ref{sec:results_JAM_SB}, Figure \ref{fig:JAM_modelA2}). It also cannot be explained by a strong contribution of DM inside the bulge together with a moderate tagential velocity anisotropy, because the corresponding DM halos would still be too massive to fit the data in the outer regions (see Section \ref{sec:results_JAM_NFW}, Figure \ref{fig:modelB4_vrms}]).

In Section \ref{sec:results_JAM_SB} we created a dynamical model from only the surface brightness distribution and an increasing mass-to-light ratio profile without additional DM halo. We found that such a model would be perfectly consistent with the lensing results and predict a total $\Upsilon_\text{I,tot}(R'\sim0) = 2.53$ in the center of J1331. This is very close to the stellar $\Upsilon_\text{I,*}^\text{Chabrier} = 2.5 \pm 0.6$ based on the estimates by \citet{SWELLSI} for the bulge stellar mass using the Chabrier IMF , i.e., less bottom-heavy (more bluish) population.

Another feature in the stellar kinematics, that none of our JAM models was able to reproduce in the slightest and which we therefore excluded in the modelling, was the dip in $v_\text{rms}$ around $\sim 6''$, which occurs around the transition from bulge to disk (see Figures \ref{fig:F814W} and \ref{fig:kinematics}).



The above discussion motivates the following speculation: In the absence of a strong DM contribution in the center, the overall stellar-mass-to-light ratio within the Einstein radius indicates a bottom-heavy IMF close to the Salpeter IMF, consistent with estimates from the velocity dispersion. At the same time the central dip can then be only explained, if there was an increase in stellar mass-to-light ratio with radius \textit{within} the bulge. \emph{If} there was a central stellar population with an IMF close to the \citet{Chabrier2003} IMF, surrounded by a more bottom-heavy population, the central stellar kinematics would be well explained and be fully consistent with the lensing results. (According to Figure \ref{fig:lenscompareboth} the lensing result might not predict a mass to light ratio gradient inside $R_\text{ein}$, but then again the mass slope $alpha=1$ was only weakly constrained.) The disk of J1331 has a lower $\Upsilon_\text{I,*}$ than the bulge (see Table \ref{tab:previousresults} according to \citet{SWELLSI}). Such a drop in $\Upsilon_\text{I,*}$ at the transition region from bulge to disk around $\sim 5''$ could lead to the observed drop in $v_\text{rms}$, while an increasing contribution of a lower mass DM halo at larger radii as found by \citet{SWELLSV}, would recover the kinematics in the out regions of J1331's disk.
