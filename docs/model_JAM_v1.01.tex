\subsection{Jeans Axisymmetric Modelling (JAM)}

Jeans axisymmetric models (JAM) assume galaxies (1a) to be collisionless, i.e. the collisionless Boltzmann equation for the distribution function $f(\vect{x},\vect{v},t)$ has to be satisfied ($\frac{\diff f(\vect{x},\vect{v},t}{\diff t} = 0$), (1b) in a steady state ($\frac{\partial}{\partial t} = 0$), (1c) axisymmetric (best described in cylindrical coordinates $(R,z,\phi)$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} = 0$) and (2) to have their velocity ellipsoid aligned with the cylindrical coordinate system. From this follow the Jeans equations as the vector-valued first moment of the Boltzmann equation, i.e.
