\subsection{Mass distribution from lensing} \label{sec:results_lensing}

In this section we use the gravitational lensing formalism summarized in Section \ref{sec:lensing_theo} to fit a scale-free galaxy mass model to the positions of the lensing images observed in J1331's central region.

\paragraph{Image positions.} We determine the positions of the lensing images by first subtracting a smooth model for the galaxy's surface brightness from the original image. As models we use MGE fits and IRAF \emph{ellipse} fits to J1331 in each the F450W and F814W filter. The lensing images become visible in the residuals (see Figure \ref{fig:lens_just_imgpos}). Because the images are extended, we use the position of the brightest pixel in each of the images. In addition, we consider the F450W-MGE subtracted residuals from \citet{SWELLSIII}. The lensing positions, as determined from the latter, are given in Table \ref{tab:lenspos}. The scatter of lensing positions, as determined from subtracting different brightness models from the galaxy in different filters, gives an error of $\pm 1$ pixel on the image positions. To the galaxy center, which we assume to be the surface brightness peak in the F450W image, we apply an error of $\pm \sqrt{2}$ pixel.

Eight image position coordinates allow us to fit a lens mass model with only $<8$ free parameters. We therefore do not fit Fourier components $(a_k,b_k)$ with $k > 3$ in the lens mass model in Equations \eqref{eq:scalefreemodel}-\eqref{eq:Fourieransatz}.

Even though the constraint from the image positions on $\alpha$ is very weak, we were however able to show that the image positions in Table \ref{tab:lenspos} are consistent with a model with flat rotation curve. In the following we therefore set $\alpha=1$.

\caption{Lensing model (Table \ref{tab:bestfitlensmodel}) found as best fit to the image positions. In the background we show the central region of J1331 in the F450W filter, subtracted by an IRAF \emph{ellipse} model of the F450W surface brightness and smoothed to remove noise smaller than the PSF. The brightness peaks of the four lensing images and the galaxy center (Table \ref{tab:lenspos}) are marked as red dots. For the best fit lens model we show the Einstein radius (red dotted circle) and the critical curve (red solid line), which are located in the lens plane. We also show the caustic (green solid line) corresponding to the critical curve and the best fit source position (green dot), which are located in the source plane. For $\alpha=1$ the critical curve is a contour of constant surface density of the mass model. The grey  lines show contours of the time delay surface given by Equation \eqref{eq:timedelay}. Not only the position of the extrema, but also their shape is consistent with the observed, extended images, even though we did not use information about the image shape in the analysis.}

%========================================================================================

\paragraph{Best fit lens model.} We fit the lens mass model to the image positions in Table \ref{tab:lenspos} by minimizing $\chi^2 = \chi_\text{lens}^2 + \chi_\text{shape}^2$ (see Equations \eqref{eq:chi2lens}-\eqref{eq:chi2total}). The best fit parameters are given in the first column of Table \ref{tab:bestfitlensmodel}. Figure \ref{fig:bestfitlensmodel} shows the corresponding critical curve, caustic and Einstein radius, and the best fit source position. In this case, where $\alpha=1$, the (tangential) critical curve is also an equidensity contour of the galaxy model \citep{EvansWitt}, which appears to have an elliptical mass distribution. The source is located close to a cusp of the diamond-shaped caustic: a lensing configuration for which we indeed expect four images. Figure \ref{fig:bestfitlensmodel} also shows the (smoothed) residuals from the F450W image subtracted by an IRAF \emph{ellipse} brightness model and the contours of the best fit model's time delay surface. This demonstrates that, although we did not include any information about the shape of the lensing images in the fit, it is consistent with the predicted distortion for an extended source.

To allow for a qualitative comparison of the contours in panel (c), the light distribution was turned into a mass distribution by multiplication with the total mass-to-light ratio inside the Einstein radius, $\Upsilon_\text{I,tot}^\text{ein} = 5.56 \Upsilon_{I,\odot}$. The Einstein radius is overplotted as red dotted circle. The uncertainties in the mass model in the second column of Table \ref{tab:bestfitlensmodel} were translated into random Monte Carlo noise in the mass contours. The smooth black contours correspond to the best fit model in the first column of Table \ref{tab:bestfitlensmodel}. We find, that the lens mass model is more roundish than the light distribution. The background in Panel (c) shows again the surface brightness subtracted center of the galaxy to make the lensing images visible.}

To estimate how the uncertainties in the determination of image positions and galaxy center affect the results, we sample random positions from two-dimensional Normal distributions with peaks and standard deviations according to Table \ref{tab:lenspos}. Model fits to many sampled image positions lead to probability distributions for the best fit shape parameters and Einstein quantities; peak and standard deviations are given in the second column of Table \ref{tab:bestfitlensmodel}. We constrain the Einstein radius to within 2\%, $R_\text{ein} = (0.91 \pm 0.02)''$ and the projected mass within the critical curve with a relative error of 4\%, $M_\text{crit} =(7.9\pm0.3)\cdot 10^{10} M_\odot$. Our measurement of $R_\text{ein}$ is consistent with that from \citet{SWELLSIII}, $R_\text{ein,SWELLS} = (0.96 \pm 0.04)''$ (which used a singular isothermal ellipsoid as lens mass model and the intermediate-axis convention of the critical curve as the Einstein radius). The relative difference between our critical mass and that of \citet{SWELLSIII}, $M_\text{crit,SWELLS} =(8.86\pm0.61)\cdot 10^{10} M_\odot$, is 13\%.




\paragraph{Comparison with light distribution.} The surface mass distribution as predicted by the best fit lens model (Table \ref{tab:bestfitlensmodel}) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lenscomparemass}. We visualize the effect of the Fourier shape parameter uncertainties by introducing random noise to create a mock observation. From the mock image's second moment we find an average axis ratio for the lens mass model of $q_\text{lens} \simeq 0.695$, which is consistent with the one found by \citet{SWELLSIII}, $q_\text{lens,SWELLSIII} = 0.67 \pm 0.09$, while the light's average axis ratio is $q' = 0.598$ (see Table \ref{tab:galaxyparameters}).

We estimate the total mass-to-light ratio within the Einstein radius $\Upsilon_\text{I,tot}^\text{ein} \equiv M_\text{ein} / L_\text{I,ein}$. For this, we integrate the MGE in Table \ref{tab:MGEF814W} to get the total I-band luminosity within the Einstein radius $L_\text{I,ein} = 1.40\cdot 10^{10} L_\odot$. The corresponding Einstein mass-to-light ratio is therefore $\Upsilon_\text{I,tot}^\text{ein} = 5.56 \Upsilon_{I,\odot}$. This is consistent with or slightly larger than the stellar mass-to-light ratio assuming a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) $\Upsilon_\text{I,*}^\text{sal} = 4.7 \pm 1.2$ according to \citet{SWELLSI} and Table \ref{tab:previousresults} (see also discussion in Section \ref{sec:MLdiscussion}).

We use $\Upsilon_\text{I,tot}^\text{ein}$ to transform the observed surface brightness in the F814W filter into a surface mass density (Figure \ref{fig:lenscomparelight}). Figure \ref{fig:lenscompareboth} then compares equidensity contours of both the predicted lens mass distribution and the observed surface brightness times $\Upsilon_\text{I,tot}^\text{ein}$.

Figure \ref{fig:lenslightcompareALL} leads to the following three findings: (1)The mass predicted from lensing and the observed light distribution are oriented in the same direction (i.e., have the same position angle). (2) Within and around the Einstein radius, mass and light distribution have a similar elliptical shape, while further out the mass distribution is slightly rounder. (3) The light distribution drops faster than the mass with increasing radius (which is---at least partly---because of the assumption of a flat rotation curve). However, the mass distribution is only constraint around the Einstein radius and otherwise an extrapolation.
