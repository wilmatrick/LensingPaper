Glenn and Aaron fragen:
* Do I need Acknowledgments? Should I thank the SWELLS team?

* Is there a classical reference for mass-anisotropy degeneracy? (Found many papers mentioning it, but none of them used references...) (I need this reference in section 4.3.2
JAM with ”mass-follows-light”anisotropy)

* "The mass profile at larger galactocentric radii can be probed by gas rotation curves that directly measure the galaxy’s circular velocity profile (e.g., Rubin et al. 1980)." Can I use the classical "flat rotation curve --> DM" paper as reference for this sentence? They used Halpha curves, so that should be ok, right?
